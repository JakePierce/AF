    <p>WHAT IS PILATES...Pilates is a physical fitness system developed in the early 20th century by Joseph Pilates. Pilates may sound intimidating, but it's an accessible way to build strength in your core muscles for better posture, balance and flexibility. Pilates is a method of exercise that consists of low-impact flexibility and muscular strength and endurance movements. Pilates emphasizes use of the abdominals, lower back, hips and thighs.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Where to Start</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>…Your choice, actually!  You should start with level I, but the type of class is up to you.  Mat is not a prereq for Reformer or Barre, Reformer is not a prereq for CoreAlign, etc.  You can find videos on youtube to see the various types of equipment in use.</p>    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Mat</b> is on the floor, like yoga, mostly you and gravity, but can include props.  E.G. the ring, balls, straps.a good workout, definitely improves awareness & control of your muscles.  Very core-centric, you will feel it in your abs after class!</li><br>
      <li><b>Reformer</b> is on resistance machines, and is a bit more full body.  Some of the exercises are againstresistance (strength building exercises), some use the springs as support, and some use light springs and are about muscle control & balance. The exercises are complementary, neither requires having taken the other type.  Most of our clients choose one or the other based on preference, they just like one more than the other.</li><br>
      <li><b>Barre Mat</b> is 2/3rds Barre work & 1/3rd Mat.  The Barre work will have a lot of leg work and cardio, done tobeat. You’ll feel this in your thighs, and really burn fat!</li><br>
      <li><b>CoreAlign</b> has more balance and control work than Reformer, but is also full body. Most work is done instanding position.​</li><br>
      <li><b>TRX</b> is suspension training. Quick transitions, and a full body workout keep you on your toes.  Yourbodyweight creates the resistance, you change it by adjusting position and angle.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>We highly recommend a private session if you are new to Pilates. Meeting with one of our certified instructors can help you determine which classes are best for your body and health.</p>
    <p>There is no need to bring any gear or equipment, anything the instructors might ask you to use we have on site.  If you prefer to bring your own, we certainly don't mind, of course.</p>
    <p>WHAT TO WEAR...Please wear comfortable clothes.  You may want to bring a water bottle  (we have water fountains here to refill it), or a towel for sweat.</p>
